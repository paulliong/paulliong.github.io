					<section class="aboutText aboutAnimation"> I am an Indonesian passport holder, was born in Jakarta, the capital city, and have not lived anywhere else. I attended and graduated high school as a member of the Jakarta Intercultural School's class of 2019. Currently, I am a sophomore attending Northwestern University with intent to complete a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. In terms of focus, I'm still learning but interested in areas of Artificial Intelligence and Game Development.  </section>

					<section class="aboutText aboutAnimation"> <br><br> My hobbies include golfing, playing the saxophone, and gaming. I am also an avid collector of classic stereo systems, CDs, and vinyls; I listen to a broad range of genres, so most of my collection may seem random at times! Growing up in a highly urban area, I wasn't able to experience the outdoors on a daily basis, but I try to go to the island of Bali a few times a year just to experience its beautiful beaches, mountains, and forests. </section>
